					<font size="+2">T</font>o Sherlock Holmes she is always <i>the</i> woman. I have seldom heard
					him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses
					and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt
					any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that
					one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but
					admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect
					reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a
					lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never
					spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They
					were admirable things for the observer—excellent for drawing the
					veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner
					to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
					adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which
					might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a
					sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power
					lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a
					nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and
					that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable
					memory.
					</p><p>
					I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us
					away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the
					home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first
					finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to
					absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of
					society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in
					Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from
					week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the
					drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still,
					as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his
					immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in
					following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which
					had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time
					to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons
					to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up
					of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,
					and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so
					delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.
					Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely
					shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of
					my former friend and companion.
					</p><p>
					One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was
					returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to
					civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I
					passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated
					in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the
					Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes
					again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.
					His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw
					his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against
					the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head
					sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who
					knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their
					own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his
					drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new
					problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which
					had formerly been in part my own.
					</p><p>
					His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I
					think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly
					eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars,
					and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he
					stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular
					introspective fashion.
					</p><p>
					“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have
					put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”
					</p><p>
					“Seven!” I answered.
					</p><p>
					“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more,
					I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not
					tell me that you intended to go into harness.”
					</p><p>
					“Then, how do you know?”
					</p><p>
					“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting
					yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and
					careless servant girl?”
					</p><p>
					“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly
					have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true
					that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful
					mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you
					deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has
					given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it
					out.”
					</p><p>
					He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands
					together.
					</p><p>
					“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the
					inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it,
					the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they
					have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round
					the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.
					Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile
					weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting
					specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a
					gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black
					mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge
					on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted
					his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce
					him to be an active member of the medical profession.”
					</p><p>
					I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
					process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I
					remarked, “the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously
					simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each
					successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you
					explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good
					as yours.”
					</p><p>
					“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing
					himself down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe.
					The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen
					the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.”
					</p><p>
					“Frequently.”
					</p><p>
					“How often?”
					</p><p>
					“Well, some hundreds of times.”
					</p><p>
					“Then how many are there?”
					</p><p>
					“How many? I don’t know.”
					</p><p>
					“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is
					just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps,
					because I have both seen and observed. By the way, since you are
					interested in these little problems, and since you are good
					enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you
					may be interested in this.” He threw over a sheet of thick,
					pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the table.
					“It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”
